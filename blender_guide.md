# ParaView to Blender Headless

This guide explains my process for Scientific Visualization in Blender, as well as provides an example scene. 

## Overview

The scientific visualization process begins in ParaView, exports to either PLY or VDB, then imports in Blender. In Blender, I use the GUI to fine tune the visuals of the scene, then recreate the scene in Python to render in parallel using Blender headless and the Python API.
