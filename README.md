# ParaView to Blender Headless Example

This guide explains my process for Scientific Visualization in Blender by building and rendering an example scene. 

## Overview

The scientific visualization process begins in ParaView, exports to either PLY or VDB, then imports in Blender. In Blender, I use the GUI to fine tune the visuals of the scene, then recreate the scene in Python to render in parallel using Blender headless and the Python API. I'll go through the process step-by-step, so that I can capture the various considerations I make when transforming and exporting data. 

For this guide, I will be using [this](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/cooley/software-and-libraries/paraview-tutorial/) dataset. 

## ParaView

import data

Starting in ParaView, import all the data sources from the dataset. It should look something like this.

When moving from ParaView to something like Blender, it is important to keep in mind the type of data that is being displayed. The blood cells, rbc and bad_rbc, are Polkygonal Meshes, so it is relatively straight forward to export them to a mesh format that Blender can read. Simply select the rbc and bad_rbc data sources one at a time and click on `File > Save Data`. Save them as PLYs (you could export as other file types, such as OBJ or STL, but I use PLY for the vertex colors option). The continuum, on the other hand, is an Unstructured Mesh. This means we will have to apply some sort of filter to transform the data into a format better suited for Blender. What we choose depends on what is desired for the final visualization. For this guide, I will explain two methods: polygonal surface with a color map, or an OpenVDB volume representation. 

I'll start with the continuum mesh. To save the continuum data source as a polygonal mesh, all you need to do is apply the "Extract Surface" filter in ParaView. You will then be able to `File > Save Data` to export the continuum as a PLY. This will save the mesh with vertex colors matching however it is displayed on screen. You will want to make sure that, in ParaView, you are visualizing the scalar field you want with the most appropriate color map. If you would rather edit the color map in Blender, apply a black and white color scale to the mesh in ParaViewâ€”we can create a custom color map later in Blender. 

To save the continuum as a volume in the OpenVDB format, we'll need to convert the Unstructured Grid to a Structured Grid (similar to the voxel format OpenVDB expects). To do this, apply a "Resample to Image" filter. You'll need to set the XYZ sampling dimensions. For this dataset, I have the sample dimensions set to 1024 x 512 x 512. Next, set the visualization mode in ParaView to "Volume". You should see something like the screenshot below. Once you see this, you can `File > Save Data` to export to an OpenVDB file. VDBs are tyically large, so be aware that exporting one or multiple VDBs may take several minutes.

If you are using the blood flow dataset, you should now have 10 PLY files for each data source (one file per time step).
